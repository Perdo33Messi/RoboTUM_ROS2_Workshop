# RoboTUM ROS2 Workshop üöÄ

Welcome to the **RoboTUM** ROS 2 Workshop!  

This project is designed to help you get started with ROS 2 and understand its core concepts through hands-on programming.  

We'll walk you through key components like Topics, Services, Actions, Nodes, and Launch files with clear and structured examples.

---

## üìö Workshop Goals

- Understand the basic communication mechanisms in ROS 2 (Topic / Service / Action)
- Learn how to write and run simple ROS 2 nodes (mainly in Python, with some C++ examples)
- Use launch files to organize project structure

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Environment Requirements

Recommended development environment:

- **ROS 2 Rolling**  
- **Ubuntu 24.04**
- **colcon**
- **Python 3.10+**
- **C++17**

*Note*: This project is also expected to be compatible with **ROS 2 Humble + Ubuntu 22.04**.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Perdo33Messi/RoboTUM_ROS2_Workshop.git
cd RoboTUM_ROS2_Workshop
```  

### 2. Create a ROS 2 workspace and build
```bash
mkdir -p ~/ros2_ws/src
cp -r . ~/ros2_ws/src/ # Copy all the code you just cloned to the workspace ~/ros2_ws/src/.
cd ~/ros2_ws # Note that you must be back to the workspace root directory
source /opt/ros/rolling/setup.bash  # or source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
colcon build # Note that you must execute the colcon build command in the workspace root directory
source install/setup.bash
```

## üéØ Target Audience

- Undergraduate or graduate students interested in robotics or ROS  
- Beginners with little or no experience in ROS 2  
- Developers who want to understand the principles behind ROS communication models
